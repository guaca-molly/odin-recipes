  World's best carrot cake
</h3>
<p>
  Today I’m sharing another cupcake recipe made big, with this full-sized version of my popular carrot cake cupcakes.
</p>
<p>
  It’s a spiced carrot cake filled with juicy raisins and topped with smooth cream cheese buttercream.
</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
  <li>3 large eggs</li>
  <li>225 g carrots</li>
  <li>250 g self-raising flour</li>
  <li>200 g brown sugar</li>
  <li>225 ml vegetable or sunflower oil</li>
  <li>¾ tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
  <li>1½ tsp ground cinnamon</li>
  <li>½ tsp ground mixed spice</li>
  <li>150 g raisins</li>
  <li>100 g butter</li>
  <li>100 g icing sugar</li>
  <li>200 g cream cheese</li>
  <li>¼ tsp vanilla extract</li>
  <li>12 sugar carrots</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Pre-heat your oven to 180°C/160°C fan. Line two 20cm round sandwich tins with greaseproof paper or re-usauble baking liners.</li>
  <li>Place the raisins (150g) into a bowl and cover them with water.</li>
  <li>Coarsely grate the carrot (225g).</li>
  <li>Whisk together the oil (225ml sunflower or vegetable oil) and brown sugar (200g) until combined.</li>
  <li>Whisk in the eggs (3 large) until combined. The mixture will lighten in colour and look glossy.</li>
  <li>Sift in the self-raising flour (250g), bicarbonate of soda (¾ tsp), ground cinnamon (1½ tsp) and ground mixed spice (½ tsp). Fold them into the other ingredients.</li>
  <li>Drain the raisins and add them and the grated carrot to the cake mixture. Fold them into the other ingredients.</li>
  <li>Split the cake mixture between the two pre-prepared tins. Use the back of a spoon or a spatula to spread the mixture evenly in the tins.</li>
  <li>Bake for 35-40 minutes until a skewer inserted into the cake comes out clean. Once baked, remove the cakes from the oven and leave them to cool in their tins for 10 minutes, before removing the tins and placing the cakes onto a wire rack to cool completely before decorating.
  </li>
  <li>Cut the butter (100g) into cubes and beat until soft.</li>
  <li>Add the icing sugar (100g) and beat it into the butter until soft and fully combined. I usually add my icing sugar 1 heaped tablespoon at a time to avoid it flying everywhere.</li>
  <li>Add the cream cheese and beat it into the other ingredients. I prefer to beat in the cream cheese by hand with a wooden spoon a few tablespoons at a time rather than using an electric mixer as I find it easier to combine it evenly.</li>
  <li>Place the bottom layer of your sponge onto your serving dish.</li>
  <li>Add half of the cream cheese buttercream and spread it evenly across the cake with a palette knife or the back of a spoon.</li>
  <li>Add the second sponge.</li>
  <li>Spread the remaining buttercream across the top of the cake, again with a palette knife or the back of a spoon. I've used the tip of my palette knife to make a swirl starting from the outside edge of the cake and working inwards.</li>
  <li>Finally, finish your cake by arranging your sugar carrots around the edge.
  </li>

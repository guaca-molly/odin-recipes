  Cheesy vegan Lasagna
</h3>
<p>
  This classic lasagna is made with an easy vegetable sauce as the base. Layer the sauce with noodles and vegan cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family, and freezes well, too.

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
  <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
  <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
  <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
  <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
  <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
  <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
  <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
  <li>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
  <li>1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles (requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken)</li>
  <li>15 ounces vegan ricotta cheese</li>
  <li>1 1/2 pounds (24 ounces) vegan mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced</li>
  <li>1/4 pound (4 ounces) freshly grated vegan Parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Start by making the sauce with bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
  <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
  <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
  <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
